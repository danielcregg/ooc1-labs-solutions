Complete lab solutions for the Object-Oriented Computing 1 (OOC1) module at Atlantic Technological University (ATU). These exercises cover foundational Java programming and core object-oriented principles.

## Overview

This repository contains worked solutions for all OOC1 lab exercises, organized by topic. Each package demonstrates a specific concept with well-commented Java source files that students can reference when studying. The repository includes a VS Code Dev Container configuration for a consistent Java 21 development environment.

## Features

- **Introductory exercises** covering Hello World, variables, and basic syntax
- **Data types and operators** with casting, user input, and arithmetic examples
- **Control flow** including if-else statements, switch, for/while/do-while loops, and break/continue
- **Arrays** with 1D and 2D array manipulation, for-each loops, and a TicTacToe game
- **Classes and objects** with Car, Dog, and Student modeling examples
- **Encapsulation** demonstrating getters, setters, and access modifiers
- **Inheritance** through animal, vehicle, beverage, and human hierarchies
- **Polymorphism** covering method overloading, overriding, and reference types
- **Abstraction** with abstract classes, interfaces, and multiple inheritance via interfaces
- **APIE principles** combining Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- A Java IDE or text editor (VS Code with Java Extension Pack recommended)
- Alternatively, use the included Dev Container for a preconfigured environment

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielcregg/ooc1-labs-solutions.git
cd ooc1-labs-solutions
```

### Usage

Compile and run any solution from the project root. For example:

```bash
javac -d bin src/ie/atu/intro/HelloWorld.java
java -cp bin ie.atu.intro.HelloWorld
```

Or open the project in VS Code and use the Dev Container for a ready-to-go Java 21 environment with the Java Extension Pack preinstalled.
